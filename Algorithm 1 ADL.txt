My Algorithm used: FindInfluencers 

Input: AdjacencyList (list of neighbors for each node) 

Output: Influencers (list of nodes with the highest degree) 

  

Begin 

    MaxDegree ← 0 

    Influencers ← Empty List 

  

    For each Node in AdjacencyList do 

        Degree ← Size of AdjacencyList[Node]  // Count neighbors of the Node 

  

        If Degree > MaxDegree then 

            MaxDegree ← Degree 

            Influencers ← [Node]  // Reset Influencers list with the new Node 

  

        Else If Degree = MaxDegree then 

            Append Node to Influencers  // Add Node to the list of Influencers 

  

    End For 

  

    Return Influencers 

End
